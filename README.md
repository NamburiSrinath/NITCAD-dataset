# NITCAD-dataset
As part of our major project, we have worked on to develop a dataset for autonomous vehicles in India (named it as NITCAD). In addition to that, we have worked on KITTI dataset and here are few algorithms to mention

KITTI LiDAR dataset
1. Gaussian Mixture Model
2. Fast Segmentation
3. Connected Component Labelling

KITTI object detection 
1. Faster R-CNN
2. YOLO

Depth estimation by Stereo Vision based approach
1. MC-CNN (Matching Cost CNN)
2. Inbuild functions from OpenCV

Velocity estimation by using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform), YOLO and MC-CNN

Monocular Visual Odometry (Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi feature tracker)

Object recognition by DenseNet, Inceptionv3, MobileNet, NASNet, VGG16 and Xception (keras implementation)
