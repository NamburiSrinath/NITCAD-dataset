# NITCAD-dataset

As part of our major project, we have worked on to develop a dataset for autonomous vehicles in India (named it as NITCAD). 

Please refer to [NITCAD DATASET PAPER](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.04.022) for paper regarding NITCAD dataset and consider to cite as

Srinath, Namburi GNVV Satya Sai, et al. "NITCAD-Developing an object detection, classification and stereo vision dataset for autonomous navigation in Indian roads." Procedia Computer Science 171 (2020): 207-216.

in case the dataset is helpful for you.

In addition to that, we have worked on KITTI dataset and here are few algorithms that we had worked

## KITTI LiDAR dataset
1. Gaussian Mixture Model
2. Fast Segmentation
3. Connected Component Labelling

## Object detection 
1. Faster R-CNN
2. YOLO

## Depth estimation by Stereo Vision based approach
1. MC-CNN (Matching Cost CNN)
2. Inbuild functions from OpenCV

Velocity estimation by using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform), YOLO and MC-CNN (Refer paper)

Monocular Visual Odometry (Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi feature tracker)

Object recognition by DenseNet, Inceptionv3, MobileNet, NASNet, VGG16 and Xception (Keras implementation)
